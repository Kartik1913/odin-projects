    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Poha (flattened rice) is Indiaâ€™s favorite breakfast. Made in different ways in different regions, it is easy to make and tastes delicious. It is also considered as one of the healthiest breakfast options. The grain just needs some soaking and thatâ€™s it. You do not need to cook it separately like other grains. For such a classic recipe, everyone has their own versions. I am sharing my version with you which I make every other day for breakfast.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Direction</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the poha in a sieve as shown in the video. Wash the poha thoroughly under running water for 10 seconds. Use your fingers to make sure every grain is washed. Place the sieve on a bowl so that all the excess water drains out. Set it aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a kadhai or pan. Fry the raw peanuts in the hot oil for about 30 seconds till they turn crunchy. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same kadhai, add some mustard seeds. Wait for them to splutter.</li>    
        <li>Add the split chickpeas followed by the finely chopped ginger. Stir for ten seconds on medium flame.</li>
        <li>Next, add the onions.  Saute the onions for a minute and then add the sugar. The onions need to be cooked on medium flame till they brown. The sugar will help it cook faster, add a beautiful brown colour to it and also make the poha slightly sweet.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are soft, add the curry leaves and give it a good stir.</li>
        <li>Among the vegetables, the potatoes will go in first. This is because they will take longer to cook. Fry the potatoes for five minutes in medium flame.</li>  
        <li>The peas will follow next. Add them to the potatoes and give it a light mix. Now cover and cook for about five minutes in low flame till the potatoes and peas are cooked.</li>
        <li>Once the vegetables are cooked, add the chopped tomatoes and cover again for the minute.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and turmeric. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Check on the washed poha and use your fingers to separate the grains. Add them to the vegetables and mix well. Keep the flame at low at this point.</li>
        <li>Throw in the fried peanuts towards the end and mix everything well. Every grain of the poha must be layered with the masala.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a drizzle of lime juice on top. </li>
    </ol>
